Cardiovascular disease(CVD) also called as heart disease is one of the major health issues faced by individuals. It is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the global population. Heart Disease are often referred to as a silent killer because the person dies from it without displaying any overt signs. Deaths from CVDs have been on the rise in recent decades as a result of the lifestyle we lead. For high-risk individuals, an early diagnosis of heart disease is crucial for helping them decide whether to change their lifestyle, which lowers consequences. The ability to detect heart anomalies in their early stages is uncommon in the medical field and it is time consuming and complicated.

To overcome this barrier, a system is proposed that analyses the patientâ€™s data to determine whether or not the heart is diseased.In this paper
we carried out various machine learning techniques for detecting heart anomalies.
